You forgot to set a timezone on the timestamp you just set in an embed!

Hikari converts all datetime objects to UTC (GMT+0) internally, since
Discord expects all timestamps to be provided using UTC. This means
that failing to set a timezone may result in bugs where the time appears
to be incorrectly offset by several hours.

To avoid this, you should tell the datetime to use the system timezone
explicitly, or specify a timezone when creating your datetime object.
Hikari will detect this and perform the correct conversion for you.

  timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().astimezone()
  # or
  timestamp = datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc)

NOTE: datetime.utcnow WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION.

Relying on timezone-naive datetimes may be deprecated and result in
an error in future releases.

The offending line of code causing this warning was:
